        <p class ="center"> My little girl has graduated college, I am so insanely proud of you. 
            In some way, I was with you through your entire college career. From our early game pigeon days, to now
            I have seen you work harder than anyone I have ever known. I have watched you blossom into a successful and
            driven woman and this is only your beginning. Even when I hardly knew you personally, the one thing I was 
            always sure of, was that you are brilliant. No, you are not just "book smart", you are the kind of brilliant
            that just radiates off a person. In every way, you are the most intelligent person I have ever met. Your drive 
            is truly unmatched and I know your potential is through the roof. I am not just saying this because I am your
            girlfriend and I should think these things. I am saying these as your best friend, the person who knows you 
            the best, because since I am the one who knows you best, I can speak confidently about your brilliance. With that
            being said, between your intelligence and your motivation there is nobody more capable of the medicine track than
            you. Your future is out there waiting for you to just go out and grab it, so with the right mentality it is all 
            yours. 
            This website will always be here for you when you need some encouragement, or just some comfort.
